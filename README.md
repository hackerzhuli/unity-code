# Unity Code Pro - Professional Unity Development in VS Code

🚀 **Supercharge your Unity development workflow with Unity Code Pro!**

Unity Code Pro is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that brings professional Unity development tools directly to your code editor. Unity Code Pro delivers a seamless Unity development experience with comprehensive features for modern Unity development.

> **📋 Platform Support:** Currently supports Windows x64 only. For other platforms (Linux, macOS), you can build the extension yourself from the source code.
> 
> **⚠️ Unity Version Requirement:** Our companion Unity package requires Unity 6.0 or higher.
>
> **⚠️ About the name:** Sorry for the Pro at the end of the name that sounds like a paid extension, I intended to call it Unity Code, but vs marketplace doesn't allow extensions with the same name, and the name Unity Code is already taken. So Pro it is, but it is still totally free and open source!
