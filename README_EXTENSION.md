# Unity Code - Unity IDE right inside Cursor, Windsurf and Trae!

🚀 **Supercharge your Unity development workflow with Unity Code!**

Unity Code is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that brings professional Unity development tools directly to your favorite code editor. Whether you're using VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or Trae, Unity Code delivers a seamless Unity development experience without the limitations of official extensions.

> **📋 Platform Support:** Currently supports Windows x64 only. For other platforms (Linux, macOS), you can build the extension yourself from the source code.
