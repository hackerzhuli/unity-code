We have a custom webfont for icons.

The file is in `assets/icons.woff`

Here is the icons table:

| Name | Description | Code | VS Code Icon ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unity-cube | Unity Cube Icon | e900 | $(unity-cube) |
| hot-reload | Hot Reload Icon | e901 | $(hot-reload) |

## Usage in VS Code Extension

These icons are registered in package.json and can be used throughout the extension using the VS Code icon syntax `$(icon-name)`.
