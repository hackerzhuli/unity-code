- [x] 1. A dedicated Unity Console to show Unity logs
- [x] 2. Unity Test result should come with stack trace and associated Unity logs(the stack trace lines should be clickable)
- [x] 3. Integrationg with Hot Reload for Unity, when Hot Reload for Unity is enabled in Unity, we should not Auto Refresh Unity, because Hot Reload for Unity will recompile and patch the code without a real compile in Unity
- [x] 4. Test Unity Project in a path with space and Chinese characters
- [x] 5. Add a setting and also a button(that show enable/disable state like other buttons) in Unity Console to ignore duplicate logs(don't store at all if it is enabled, because sometimes logs can come from Update and there can be hundreds of same logs in one second)(logs that have exactly the same content including stack trace)(true by default)
- [x] 6. Add a debug feature to attach to Unity Editor
- [x] 7. ~~Add 1 button in editor actions to enter/exit play mode according to state of Unity Editor~~
- [x] 8. ~~Add a drop down (down arrow) beside the button metioned above that shows a boolean setting whether to start/stop Hot Reload for Unity(disabled if Hot Reload for Unity package is not installed in the project)~~ 
- [x] 9. Add a status bar item right beside Unity to show the state of Hot Reload for Unity(if it is installed as a project package)
- [x] 10. Clicking on a test in Testing window (on the left side) goes to the compiled .dll not to the source file, fix it so that it goes to the source file
- [x] 11. Remove a file or folder should also remove it's meta file
- [x] 12. Automatic Rename/Remove .meta file should check for Assets folder and Packages folder, or that the file is an asset
- [x] 13. Make the log details panel down at the bottom not in the right side in Unity Console, because sometimes we have stack trace file path that can be long, better show them in one line.
- [x] 14. Don't run tests when Unity is in Play Mode.
- [x] 15. Sometimes (in rare cases) tests didn't run in Unity and we didn't detect that, resulting in test appears running for ever in VS Code.
- [x] 16. Now when we get tests, both edit mode and play mode will be blocked because of rate limits.
- [x] 17. We should refresh tests when Unity finised compilation(and we don't need a setting for it), not when user get back to VS Code
- [x] 18. We should refresh unity packages here when finished compilation, or extension activation, other refreshes are not needed.
- [x] 19. Double click on the run button beside tests in Testing window will result in individual tests appearing running forever after the whole test run finished.
- [x] 20. Running higher level tests doesn't actually run tests, the level above the assembly(the project level), and the mode level, eg. "Play Mode", running these tests, it appears in Unity Editor that the test run started, but no leaf tests are actually run. However in Unity Editor we can actually run the the project level tests, which runs all tests in all assemblies.
- [x] 21. Create/Delete/Paste a .cs asset file (for the case of create, file must be already saved to disk, and not empty, if not then do nothing) should also trigger a refresh of asset database.
- [x] 22. We shouldn't try to manage .meta files when user delete files, Unity will handle that, so no need for us to do anything
- [ ] 23. Debugger should find user assemblies in a more precise way(looking at project files), also we should remove our setting for project assemblies only because that's always true for now
- [ ] 24. Unity package should generate launch.json settings for our debugger
- [x] 25. Change our typescript compile output to CommonJS (but keeping working with esmoudles in typescript source code, also keep package.json type as module if possible) for better compatibility with current VS Code forks(some don't support modules yet). Create a seperate a build script in package.json and make sure we clean js output directory before build, compile the code and also call vsce to package it.
- [x] 26. Our binary locator should not assume what platform is supported or not(binary locator should handle at least 6 platforms, that is Windows/MacOS/Linux, each with x64 and arm64), just get the binary file for the current platform when requested
- [ ] 27. Test the extension in Cursor/Windsurf/Trae, fix bugs, add an icon for the extension, then modify the version to 1.0.0 and publish the extension to open vsx!
- [ ] 28. For logs for official Unity site(not packages), we should specify the Unity version of the project there, eg. "https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.html"
- [x] 29. Add a search bar for Unity Console to filter logs
- [ ] 30. The line break in xml docs are not proper in output markdown(they are still in the same line)
- [ ] 31. Dot Rush just released a new version that shows XML docs, try it out and determine should we remove our xml docs feature?
