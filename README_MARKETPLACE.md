# Unity Code Pro - Professional Unity Development in VS Code

üöÄ **Supercharge your Unity development workflow with Unity Code Pro!**

Unity Code Pro is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that brings professional Unity development tools directly to your code editor. Unity Code Pro delivers a seamless Unity development experience with comprehensive features for modern Unity development. And it's 100% free and open source!

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency:** This extension depends on [Dot Rush](https://github.com/JaneySprings/DotRush), which is a C# language server. If you're using C# extension or C# dev kit extension, you have to disable them in order for this extension to function correctly.
> 
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Support:** Currently supports Windows x64 only. For other platforms (Linux, macOS), you can build the extension yourself from the source code.
> 
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Unity Version Requirement:** Our companion Unity package requires Unity 6.0 or higher.
